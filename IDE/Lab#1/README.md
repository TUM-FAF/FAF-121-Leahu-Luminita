# IDE Laboratory Work #1

### Title: Command Line Interface. CLI Editor. Setting Server environment. Version Control Systems.

#### In this laboratory work I executed the following mandatory tasks:

   - **Connect to a remote server via SSH**
   - 
	In order to do this I used `putty` program. 
   - **Initialize a repository on server**
   
	`git init`
   - **Create a file in repository folder, write in your name, save and commit it**
  
   	 ```
	 mkdir Luminita 	// create a folder
	 vim text.txt   	// editor to create a text file
	 i              	// enter an insert
	 Luminita Leahu		// your text 
	 :wp				// write into file and exit
	 git add text.txt   // add the file to folder
	 git commit -m "added file with my name"
	 ```
