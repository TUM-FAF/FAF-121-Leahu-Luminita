# IDE #3

## Mobile Applications Development
  - **Android Studio**
 

### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: Android Studio
  - Languages:  Java
  - Technologies and Frameworks:  Android

### Mandatory Tasks:
  - Study design guidlines for any mobile OS ([Android](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html), [Windows Mobile](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/design))
  - Create a mobile app and launch it on emulator/simulator. Your app should have at least 3 element (ex. button, textarea, statusbar...) and one action (ex. clicking on a button will trigger a popup)

### Tasks With Points:
  - Install your application on a mobile phone. It should have somewhere your full name (on main screen, in settings...) (2pt)
  - Create 3 different views (ex. one with a list of some element, one with some settings and one with application description) (2pt)
  - Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)
  - Use a hardware device for testing and debugging (1pt)

 The result of my application:

 - Main Screen

 #### Conclusion:
 
 I liked this laboratory work, because is the first one at which I developed a mobile application, something that I can install on a phone and someone can use it. _Android Studio_ is a flexible IDE, I though that mobile applications are created harder and request special skills, platforms and others.
