# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3

### Title: Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.


   - **Contents:**
    -  Mouse
    - Device context
    - GDI Primitives
      * Line
      * Curve
      * Plane
      * Bitmap image
    - Bezier curve
## The Application Creation Steps

### In this laboratory work I executed the following mandatory tasks:

   - **Draw few lines of different colors and weights**
   - **Draw a Bezier curve**
   - **Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not**
   - **Draw 2 different objects using mouse**

### And tasks with points:

   - **Draw a custom bitmap image**
   - **Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects**
   - **Draw a Bezier curve using mouse**
   - **Fill an object with a gradient**
   - **Use mouse as an eraser of: a fixed width / a adjustable width**

### Additional tasks: 

   - **Create a button which erase all working area**

     
     
     The result of my application:

## Conclusion

This laboratory work was hard but with a lot of fun. I developed skills in working with GDI primitives. It was shown that we can draw different objects like ( lines, ellipses) with different width and colors.
