# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #4

### Title: Windows Timer. Animation.

   - **Contents:**
    - Windows timer

## The Application Creation Steps

### In this laboratory work I executed the following mandatory task:

   - Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

### And tasks with points:

   - Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel
    - this is done in `CASE WM_MOUSEWHEEL`. The speed is also changed using _ArrowUp_ and _ArrowDown_
   - Solve flicking problem
    - The flickering was solved using double buffering and avoiding the call to erase background.
   - Add animated objects which interact with each other


The result of my application:
